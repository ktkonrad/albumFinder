ABOUT:
  AlbumFinder is a bare-bones web app that creates YouTube playlists for albums.

SETUP:
  In order to run AlbumFinder you need to:
    1) Get the code
    2) Install any dependencies (BeautifulSoup, web.py, gdata)
    3) Get a Google API developer key and Amazon AWS key and secret and put them in a file called 'albumFinder.cfg' in the same directory as albumFinder.py. See albumFinder.cfg.example for format.
    4) Make albumFinder.py executable by doing `chmod +x albumFinder.py`
    5) run with `./albumFinder.py 9000` where 9000 may be replaced by a port number of your choice - default is 8080

USAGE:
  Once the web service is running go to localhost:9000 where 9000 is replaced by the port you chose in step 4) above. Enter and album and artist and submit. Grant access to YouTube when prompted.
